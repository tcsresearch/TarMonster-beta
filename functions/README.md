## What's A Function?<br>
The bash shell allows you to create <i>functions</i> â€” files containing reusable sets of code, and then <i> call </i> them in scripts where they are needed. 
<br>
In our case, we consider functions to be useful sets of code which we use in a single program.
They differ from libraries only in the fact that we don't plan on having those used with other programs.

<ul>
<li> Functions: Reusable code for use within a SINGLE program.
<li> Libraries: Reusable code for use within MULTIPLE progrms.
</ul>
