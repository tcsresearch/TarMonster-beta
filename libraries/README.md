## What's A Library?<br>
The bash shell allows you to create so-called <i>libraries</i> â€” files containing functions, and then use these libraries in any scripts where they are needed.
In our case, we consider libraries to be useful sets of functions (such as <a href="https://github.com/tcsresearch/ColorEcho"> ColorEcho </a> and <a href="https://github.com/tcsresearch/BLING"> BLING </a>) which we use in multiple programs.
They differ from functions only in the fact that we don't plan on having those used with other programs.

<br>
<ul>
<li> Functions: Reusable code for use within a SINGLE program.
<li> Libraries: Reusable code for use within MULTIPLE progrms.
</ul>
