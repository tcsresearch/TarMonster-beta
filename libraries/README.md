## What's A Library?<br>
The bash shell allows you to create so-called libraries â€” files containing functions, and then use these libraries in any scripts where they are needed.
In our case, we consider libraries to be useful sets of functions (such as ColorEcho and BLING) which we use in multiple programs.
They differ from functions only in the fact that we don't plan on having those used with other programs.
