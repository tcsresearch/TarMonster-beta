How do you print a numerically incremented value (Bash, Linux)?

While it’s easy to do a counter, as two others have done, there’s a better way: the “seq” command. The reason I call it better isn’t just that it can do sequences of numbers, e.g.
$ seq 1 3
1
2
3

But, sometimes, you need leading zeros, too. For example, our hostnames generally end with three digits, so hostfoo-001, hostfoo-002, etc. It’s easy enough to write code for that, but seq makes that WOO easy:
$ seq -w 001 003
001
002
003

That’s winning. :-)
