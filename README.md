# tarmonster
An experimental backup script utilizing tar, gzip, &amp; bzip2.  WIP.

TarMonster gets its name from both the Linux program tar and a Scooby-Doo villain.

It is intended to allow for automatic file naming with the date of the backup as part of the filename, e.g. backup-202220626-1.
For now, the primary focus is to create backups and compress them.  Restoring backups will come later.
